NASA's USIP (Undergraduate Student Instrument Project) SFRO (Student Flight Research Opportunity) Program: this project focused on the design of a small CubeSat satellite that would be launched into orbit around Earth. My team and I would then send signals via an 852 nanometer laser to test the feasibility of replacing radio frequency communications between satellites with free-space optical data transmission using high-intensity lasers. Unfortunately the project did not receive funding.
